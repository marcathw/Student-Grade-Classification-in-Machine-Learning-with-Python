# ðŸŽ“ Predicting Student Grade Class (Aâ€“F) Using CatBoost and XGBoost

This notebook builds multi-class classification models to predict students' grade classes (A, B, C, D, F) derived from GPA values. Using tree-based gradient boosting algorithms, the project analyzes various academic, demographic, and extracurricular features to accurately categorize student performance.
