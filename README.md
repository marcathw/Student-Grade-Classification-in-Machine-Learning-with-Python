# ðŸŽ“ Student Grade Classification Using CatBoost and XGBoost

A group project that builds multi-class classification models to predict students' grade classes (Aâ€“F) based on GPA-derived labels. The analysis uses CatBoost and XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation to identify patterns from student academic, demographic, and behavioral data.

- **Feature preprocessing and encoding** of categorical data.
- **Multi-class classification** using:
  - CatBoost Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
- **Hyperparameter tuning** with GridSearchCV.
- **Model evaluation** using:
  - Confusion matrix plot
  - Classification report (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
